1) Find some tags using the reference above to style some of the text on the page.

2) Make one of your favorite places to eat your own kitchen. Create another HTML page for your kitchen (e.g. my_kitchen.html). Make sure you link to your new page from the main page. Also make sure you can get back to your main page from your new page. This page should NOT open in a new window.

3) Add a contact form to your page. This form does not need to function. Only worry about getting in to display on your page. Collect the users name, email, and comment.
